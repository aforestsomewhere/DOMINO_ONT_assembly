The config file is generated by executing the "generate_config.sh" script in the main directory (./generate_config.sh). It reads and processes sample names and genome sizes, and determines output path folders.

A sample config.yaml is provided. Note that the variables "shell_executable" and "shell_prefix" may vary across different cluster implementations/environments, and can be modified to suit requirements as needed.
